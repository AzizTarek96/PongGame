# PongGame
 The main objective of this project is to create a functional Pong game that can be played on an embedded system. Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The project will involve designing the gameplay, implementing the game logic, and providing a user-friendly interface.
